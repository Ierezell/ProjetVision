WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

INFO: [Labtools 27-1434] Device xc7z020 (JTAG device index = 1) is programmed with a design that has no supported debug core(s) in it.
WARNING: [Labtools 27-3361] The debug hub core was not detected.
Resolution: 
1. Make sure the clock connected to the debug hub (dbg_hub) core is a free running clock and is active.
2. Make sure the BSCAN_SWITCH_USER_MASK device property in Vivado Hardware Manager reflects the user scan chain setting in the design and refresh the device.  To determine the user scan chain setting in the design, open the implemented design and use 'get_property C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN [get_debug_cores dbg_hub]'.
For more details on setting the scan chain property, consult the Vivado Debug and Programming User Guide (UG908).
