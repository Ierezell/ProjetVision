opt_design failed
ERROR: [Opt 31-67] Problem: A LUT2 cell in the design is missing a connection on input pin I1, which is used by the LUT equation. This pin has either been left unconnected in the design or the connection was removed due to the trimming of unused logic. The LUT cell name is: HDMI_bd_i/Segmentation/c_addsub_0/U0/xst_addsub/i_baseblox.i_baseblox_addsub/no_pipelining.the_addsub/i_lut6.i_lut6_addsub/i_simple_model.carrymux0_i_1.
Resolution: Please review the preceding OPT INFO messages that detail what has been trimmed in the design to determine if the removal of unused logic is causing this error. If opt_design is being specified directly, it will need to be rerun with opt_design -verbose to generate detailed INFO messages about trimming.
